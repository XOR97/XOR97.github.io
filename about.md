## Hi. Iâ€™m Azhar.

I use this **space** to pen my thoughts on a range of topics that are at the intersection of computer science, analytics, data engineering, product design & software development.

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Engineering from the [University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en) with a focus towards Product Development & Analytics. Most recently I have worked as a Data Engineer at [RateGain](https://rategain.com). I was part of their Data Science Lab and worked on a diverse set of problems ranging from price optimizations techniques, sentiment analysis of online reviews to building custom algorithms for city demand forecasting. Prior to RateGain, I was an undergraduate at [Jamia Hamdard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamia_Hamdard) in New Delhi, where I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

Most of my experience has been focused on the design & growth of analytic-driven systems and managing their scale. Usually, that means bouncing between research, feature design/development, growth analysis, and team coordination.

I love working on tools, infrastructure and scaling applications from the ground up. Heavily reliant on [Python](https://www.python.org) to get me out of trouble but sometimes also program in [Golang](https://golang.org) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org). 

I'm also an opensource contributor and regularly devote my time to projects like [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) & [Coala](https://coala.io/). 

When not writing code, I can be found playing football (soccer if you may), following the Champions League (Hala Madrid!), backpacking across the Indian subcontinent and outside of it once in a while. An avid quizzer who occasionally brags about random trivia that no one seems to care. Have a weak spot for good music and standup comedy.

And I use [Atom](https://atom.io).
